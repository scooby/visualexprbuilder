Who does what?

This is supposed to be a widget that exists in a larger application that uses
the standard Swing user interface.

Unlike most widgets, the data it works with could be fairly complex.

The internal state is also fairly complex. The user can "lift" parts of the
expression to manipulate them.

Most applications will want to use an "import-manipulate-export" strategy. That

string. The widget will manipulate this string and to put the result back into

I could design an "live-objects" strategy. This would be appropriate for very
large expressions where we're not trying to visualize the entire expression at
once, however, I don't think this would be useful for this control.

Separable Model Architecture

The application must provide a model that can get and set a
